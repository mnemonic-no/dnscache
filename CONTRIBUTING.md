* If you really want to make us happy; include a way to get hold of a memory image where it is failing and as much information as possible about the system it is dumped from and how it was aquired.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
